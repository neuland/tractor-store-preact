# The Tractor Store - Preact

A micro frontends sample implementation of [The Tractor Store](https://micro-frontends.org/tractor-store/) built with Preact, ESI and Web Components. It's based on the [Blueprint](https://github.com/neuland/tractor-store-blueprint).

**Live Demo:** [TBA](#)

### Limitations

This implementation is deliberately kept simple to focus on the micro frontends aspects. URLs are hardcoded, components could be more DRY and no linting, testing or type-safety is implemented. In a real-world scenario, these aspects should be addressed properly.

### Todos

- [x] Implement all blueprint features
- [ ] Public deployment via Cloudflare Workers
- [ ] Web performance optimizations (e.g. on-demand loading, proper chunking, best practices, ...)
- [ ] Improve DX (linting, HMR, error handling)
- [ ] Fix CSS Modules warning in build process (see below)
- [ ] Show selected store on checkout page
- [ ] Migrate last lighthouse score [changes](https://github.com/neuland/tractor-store-blueprint/commit/d625f1892b9d5966b6a82c404a6d88be4bd98d56)

#### CSS Modules Warning

When running the application in development mode, the following warning is displayed multiple times:

```
[checkout] [build] initial build failed Error: Build failed with 1 error:
[checkout] [build] src/pages/CartPage.module.css:2:15: ERROR: Could not resolve "/var/folders/09/.../T/.../Users/[project]/checkout/src/pages/CartPage.css"
[checkout] [build]     at failureErrorWithLog (/Users/[project]/checkout/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:1472:15)
[checkout] [build]     at /Users/[project]/checkout/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:945:25
[checkout] [build]     at runOnEndCallbacks (/Users/[project]/checkout/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:1315:45)
```

This is a an open issue in [esbuild-plugin-css-modules#6](https://github.com/koluch/esbuild-plugin-css-modules/issues/6).
The library is used because esbuild does not yet support CSS class prefixing [esbuild#3484](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3484).
This warning can be ignored. Affected assets are rebuilt automatically.

## How to run locally

Clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuland/tractor-store-preact.git tractor-store-preact
cd tractor-store-preact
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
# install root dependencies (local only)
npm install
# install dependencies in all projects
npm run install:all
```

Start the development server:

```bash
